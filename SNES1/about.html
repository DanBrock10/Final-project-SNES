        <h1>About Super Nintendo</h1>
        <p>
          The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) is a 16-bit home video
          game console developed by Nintendo. Released in 1990, it has become
          one of the most iconic gaming systems of all time, known for its
          high-quality games and exceptional hardware for its era.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SNES featured some of the most beloved video games, such as
          <em>Super Mario World</em>,
          <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>, and
          <em>Super Metroid</em>. The console's success laid the foundation for
          the future of gaming, and it continues to be celebrated by fans
          worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since its release, the SNES has been recognized not only for its
          classic games but also for its innovative design and the way it
          revolutionized the video game industry.
